# Welcome to GigaClient GitHub 👋

Here at Gigaclient we thrive to become the next best minecraft client aside from LC and BLC.

# What do we have to improve your gaming experience? ✨
  * A complete new launcher with more exciting features
  * Ways to customize the game and unlock features blocked by servers and remove useless features
  * Fully open source projects
  * A stats proxy for Hypixel
  * And much more coming soon!

# How do we communicate 💬

We have a discord server! *(not suprising..)* but you can join it! Head over to https://join.gigaclient.lol and become a Giga-chad!

We are also going to use GitHub discussions. You can access the discussion page by clicking on the ***Discussion*** tab on our organization's page. Once there, you'll find a few categories. See news and updates in `📣 Announcements`, chat with everyone in `💬 General` and ask questions in `🙏 Q&A`.

⚠️ **We have a discord! The discord may be termed alot if we add replay mod to servers as an advanatage. Any bugs and reports can be put into our discord or/and github to add/remove!*

# Our GitHub 🦑
You can see all of our projects here, on GitHub!
